# Avalanche Intuition

This is a work-in-progress avalanche rescue simulation using Babylon.JS.

To run, this will require bypassing the browser CORS plugin. The best way to do this is to download or clone and then use Python:

```
python -m http.server
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8000 (or whatever port yours is set to) to view.
